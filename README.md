# Vocalpy notebooks

Demos using [VocalPy](https://github.com/vocalpy/vocalpy),
a core package for acoustic communication research in Python.

## Set up

1. Download this code from GitHub (or clone this repository with Git if you prefer)

2. Create a virtual environment with the packages you need installed

We recommend using the Anaconda distribution.

You can recreate the environment we used by running the following in the root of this directory:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

and then

```console
conda activate vocalpy-nb-env
```

3. Run Jupyter Lab and work through the notebook

After activating the virtual environment,
type the following in the root of this project to start up Jupyter Lab:

```console
jupyter lab
```
